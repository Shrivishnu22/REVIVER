# REVIVER

## Purpose of app
```
When there is an accident, bleeding is usually the leading cause of death or complications. As a result, we created an app that can assist volunteers or 
passers-by by providing instructions on how to stop bleeding. Home, Action, FAQs, Tracker, Emergency Dial, and References are the six sections of the app. 
It offers greetings to the user and the most recent important news events in their home area. The action section contains precise instructions and 
videos with cures for halting the bleeding. An emergency dialer can be used by anyone at any time to call for an ambulance. 
The FAQ section contains the most frequently asked questions regarding how to solve the problem. The nearby hospital tracker, 
which uses the HUAWEI Location kit, is the most useful function in the tracker area. The related publications and journal papers are found in the reference section.
